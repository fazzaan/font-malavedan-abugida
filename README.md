# Malavedan Script Font

This is the first font ever made of the recently-constructed script for the endangered Malavedan language _ChathiPaani_, a Dravidian language of Kerala and Tamil Nadu that is closely related to Malayalam.  

This font project was requested by a person of the Malavedan tribe who reached out to me on Reddit.

I'd say you can read more at the following links, but there's really not much information online.  

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malavedan_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malavedan_language)  
* [https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mjr/](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mjr/)

The script's symbols in the font are bound to their own unicode range (the [PUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas)) and directly to the Latin (English) QWERTY layout.  

## About Malavedan script

This Malavedan (_Malai Vedan_, IPA: [mɐlɐʋeːɖɐn]) script is an abugida, with visual and structural similarities to the Malayalam script.  

This Malavedan script uses 17 diacritics in total:  
* to mark 11 vowels (in addition to the inherent a)  
* a circle, for a nasal coda, perhaps similar to the anusvara of Devanagari
* a dot above, I think to mark if a letter takes syllable-final sound  
* a u above, for the removal of the inherent a, perhaps similar to the halant of Devanagari  
* a ring above, to join two consonants directly together (stronger than the 'anusvara')
* a breve below, to add an /ɹ/-like sound to the consonant
* a dot below, to indicate the corresponding letters of Malayalam that aren't present in Malavedan pronunciation  

From the tribe member who requested this font:  
> "This is for the Malavedan tribe. The name of our language is _ChathiPaani_. Chathi denotes our tribe and Paani means _language_ or _word_. Very few people are using this language in this time, the rest of them are using Malayalam."

# To Do
* add numbers  
* add basic punctuation and symbols  
* attach glyphs to sensible unicode range in PUA  
* build basic website to host fonts, text and dictionary of Malavedan language  
* create conversion script to convert between QWERTY encoding and PUA encoding (and future dedicated unicode range when it's been accepted by the Unicode Consortium)
* draft submission proposal for the Unicode Consortium for Malavedan
